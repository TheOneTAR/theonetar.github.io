   <h1>Jumbotron</h1>
   A lot of websites are taking advantage of better internet speeds by having large, beautiful images displayed right up in your face when you visit their homepage. Bootstrap calls these Jumbotrons, which is a very appropriate name. Sometimes they'll have a playlist of images playing in this space, powered by Javascript, but for this exercise just have a simply static image with some text 'floating' in the middle of it.
