      <h2>HTML and CSS Practice Exercises</h2>
      <p>Here are a series of common design elements used on the web today implemented with just simple HTML and CSS. To practice your HTML and CSS, use the pages as your "design mock-up" and then try and implement your own version that looks and responds the same way.</p>

      Present slightly twisted implementations of things to show the difference of what happens when you tweak things.

      <h2>Object Design</h2>
      <p>Object Oriented Programming requires experience defining the properties and methods of the objects to be created. Traditionally this information is conveyed with the Unified Modeling Language, in what is commonly referred to as UML Diagrams or Models.

      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>Coming up with simple exercises to do yourself can be tough. Here are some that I use in my classes while teaching basic programming. Each prompt gives an example of what the interface looks like, how the program runs, and a link to a repo that has a solution UML and the implementation of that UML.</p>
